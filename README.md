A simple, fun dice game I built as a practice project while auditing the **Learn React** course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). 

---

## How to Play
Roll dice until they all show the same number. Click to **hold** dice at their current value while you re-roll the rest â€” win when all dice are frozen and match!
